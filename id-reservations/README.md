# ID Reservations

ID reservations are used to avoid conflicts between mod developers.

The simplest way to reserve an ID range is to join the [Outward Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg/zKyfGmy7TR) and view the `#reserve-ids` channel. Alternatively, you can make a pull request directly to the JSON files in the `id-reservations` folder, if you feel comfortable doing so.
