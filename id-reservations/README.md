# ID Reservations

IDs in shared namespaces should be reserved here to avoid collisions (e.g., numeric item IDs).

All files use [JSON5](https://json5.org/) format (i.e, JSON with comments).
Every line should contain `[<first id in range>, <last id in range>, <github username>],` and lines should be kept in order.

New reservations should be made via pull-request, but you may create a [new issue][issues].
Some aspects of the files are verified as part of pull-request workflow. 

* **NOTE**: For simplicity sake, please only use the next available ID instead of leaving a gap from the previous reserved ID range, thank you.
